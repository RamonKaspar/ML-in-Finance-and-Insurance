# ML-in-Finance-and-Insurance

Coding assignments of the "Machine Learning in Finance & Insurance" course at ETH ZÃ¼rich (Fall 2024).

## Assignment 1: Pricing with linear regression

This project applies linear regression and regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso, and Truncated Pseudoinverse) on the Housing dataset to predict house prices using both numerical and one-hot-encoded categorical features. We systematically compare model performances in terms of in-sample and out-of-sample metrics. Our analysis shows that _Lasso_ achieves the best generalization, while higher-order polynomial models suffer from significant overfitting.

## Assignment 2: Credit analytics

## Assignment 3: Deep hedging

## Assignment 4: Insurance claim prediction
